# The alpha_ufld Mission

The alpha_ufld mission is a simple starting point autonomy mission using only the waypoint behavior. The vehicle proceeds through five waypoints, posting an end flag when it is completed. 

**Simulation Approach:** This mission uses the **MOOS-IvP Simulator** (uSimMarineV22) with pMarineViewer visualization by default. It includes pArduBridge for optional ArduPilot integration but does not require ArduPilot or Gazebo for basic operation.
