# moos-ivp-uav-base
Implementation of MIT autonomy middleware MOOS-IVP on UAVs. Project further developed from [Steve Carter Feujo Nomeny's work](https://github.com/Scarter668/moos-ivp-uav) for his master thesis at NTNU x MIT.

This fork aims to further develop compatibility with other vehicles (UAV, AUVs etc) and extend the capabilities of the original MOOS-IVP UAV implementation.
